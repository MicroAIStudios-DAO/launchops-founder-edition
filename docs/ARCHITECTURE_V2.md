## Executive Summary

LaunchOps Founder Edition is the ultimate "Tier 3" personal automation engine designed specifically for solopreneurs. It operates with zero guardrails, assuming full local trust to execute complex business formation, infrastructure deployment, and marketing operations.

This document outlines the architecture for the V2 upgrade, which integrates MBA-level intelligence, Harvard-style executive coaching, and a comprehensive funding intelligence layer to guide founders from ideation to capital acquisition.

## 1. Core Architecture

The system is built on a multi-agent orchestration framework, extending the original `Atlas` design from `microai-launchops` and integrating the structured task execution from `founder-autopilot`.

### 1.1 Orchestrator (`launchops.py` & `atlas/orchestrator.py`)
The central brain of the system. It manages the state, coordinates agent handoffs, and executes the master workflow.

### 1.2 Agent Ecosystem
*   **Security Agent:** Deploys and manages Vaultwarden for credential vaulting.
*   **Web/Infrastructure Agent:** Handles WordPress, Nextcloud, and other Docker-based deployments.
*   **Paralegal Bot:** Automates legal formation, compliance calendars, and document generation.
*   **Stripe Agent:** Configures payment gateways and financial plumbing.
*   **Marketing Agent:** Deploys Mautic and executes the "31-Prompt Business Builder" pipeline.
*   **ExecAI Coach (NEW):** Provides Harvard Dataverse-backed strategic advice and milestone tracking.
*   **Funding Intelligence Agent (NEW):** Analyzes business models against VC, SBIR/STTR grant, and Angel investor criteria.

## 2. The 31-Prompt Business Builder Pipeline

Integrated from `founder-autopilot`, this pipeline forces the founder to define a tight, semi-passive business model.

*   **Phase 1: Ideation & Validation (Prompts 0-5)**
    *   Setup, concept selection, validation planning, positioning, offer design, brand identity.
*   **Phase 2: Assets & Infrastructure (Prompts 6-17)**
    *   Website IA, copy, pricing, lead magnets, product blueprint, onboarding, automation architecture, legal starter pack.
*   **Phase 3: Go-To-Market & Scale (Prompts 18-31)**
    *   Channel focus, SEO, ads, outbound, unit economics, analytics, scaling plans, risk audits.

## 3. MBA Formation & Funding Intelligence Layer

This new layer ensures the company is structured correctly from Day 1 to remain eligible for diverse funding sources.

### 3.1 Entity Formation Matrix
*   **Default Recommendation:** Delaware C-Corporation (The gold standard for VC and institutional investment).
*   **Alternative:** LLC (For bootstrapped, cash-flow businesses not seeking immediate equity funding).
*   **Output:** The Paralegal Bot generates the specific Articles of Incorporation/Organization based on this decision matrix.

### 3.2 Funding Qualification Engine
Analyzes the startup against key funding avenues:
1.  **Venture Capital:** Requires Delaware C-Corp, scalable SaaS/tech model, high TAM.
2.  **SBIR/STTR Grants:** Requires for-profit US business, <500 employees, R&D focus, 51%+ US citizen ownership.
3.  **Angel/Micro-Grants:** Focuses on early traction, founder story, and local economic impact.

## 4. ExecAI Coaching & Solopreneur Documentary Pipeline

### 4.1 ExecAI Coach
A background process that monitors progress through the 31-prompt pipeline and infrastructure deployment. It uses frameworks derived from Harvard Business School case studies to provide "courage under uncertainty" advice.

### 4.2 Documentary Tracker
A logging mechanism that records key milestones (first commit, first deployment, first dollar, entity formation). It formats these logs into a narrative structure suitable for a "solopreneur documentary," demonstrating how AI + Human co-create.

## 5. Deployment Workflow

1.  **Initialization:** `$ launchops launch --name "My Startup" --type "saas"`
2.  **Strategy Phase:** ExecAI runs the 31-prompt pipeline to define the business.
3.  **Formation Phase:** Paralegal Bot executes Delaware C-Corp formation and registers for EIN.
4.  **Infrastructure Phase:** Docker compose spins up Vaultwarden, WordPress, Mautic, etc.
5.  **Funding Readiness Phase:** Funding Intelligence Agent generates a VC/Grant readiness report.
6.  **Continuous Coaching:** ExecAI provides weekly strategic reviews.
