# LaunchOps Founder Edition v2.0

**Build a business like an MBA would. AI + Human Co-Creating GREAT Things.**

LaunchOps Founder Edition is a Tier 3, no-guardrails personal automation engine that launches production-ready businesses with MBA-grade intelligence. It combines an ExecAI coaching layer (Harvard Business School frameworks), a funding intelligence engine (VC, grants, SBIR/STTR, angel), comprehensive IP protection, legal document generation, and a full infrastructure stack — all orchestrated by the Atlas engine.

This is the **solopreneur documentary edition**: every milestone, decision, and AI co-creation moment is logged and narrativized. The story writes itself as you build.
